# Python Brownbag

Learn some (very) basic Python, hopefully get sold on the language! Learn (very) basic git too!

## Before Coming

#### Python(3) via anaconda

Please try to install python, numpy, scipy, and matplotlib before coming. There is a good chance you already have python, but I recommend getting a clean, upgradable install via anaconda (which will include the other packages). Anaconda will include everything you need for all the demos Iâ€™ll run/everything posted [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).

#### git

Git is a versioning software. You are probably reading this on github, a site which hosts git repositories, allowing people to share them (or allowing you to sync between your own machines). Even if you don't convert to python, learning the basics of git could be huge for your matlab productivity. Life will also be easier if you have some form of git installed: 
- If you are on a mac: open a terminal and run `git`. If you get info on usage, you are set; otherwise, follow the prompts to install the command line tools (CLTs). There are likely newer versions you can install via homebrew or find online, but we won't worry about that for now.
- If you are running windows life is trickier: again, open a terminal and run `git`. You will probably get some error along the lines of git not existing. In that case get git [here](http://git-scm.com/download/win).
- If you are running linux it is going to vary, but it should be something like `sudo yum install git-all` or `sudo apt-get install git-all`.  I.e. you are running linux so you should probably now what your package manager is and work this out.

More info on installation on different platforms can be found [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). You can learn some of the functionality git [here](https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf).

#### Cloning this repository

I'll walk you through this on Friday, but if you want to try out git you can clone this repository. Go to your terminal, and 
``cd <directory-where-you-want-to-clone>``
then run
``git clone https://github.com/dlilien/pybb.git python_brownbag``
You can probably see a big green button in the upper-right corner of this webpage that could help you if I screwed up and that failed.
